			<h1>Chinese Zodiac</h1>
			<hr />
			<br />
			<p>The Chinese zodiac follows a twelve year cycle, each of the years being named after an animal. The Chinese zodiac signs are determined by the lunar year in which you were born. The 12-year cycle of Chinese zodiac is an approximation to the 11.86-year cycle of Jupiter, the largest planet of the solar system. It is believed that the animal ruling one's birth year has a profound influence on personality, and destiny. The saying is</p>
			<br />
			<p>"This animal hides in your heart"</p>
			<br />
			<p>Legend has it that inception of the Chinese zodiac signs began when the Buddha beckoned all the animals to bid him farewell before his departure from the Earth. Only twelve arrived at his summoning, and so those were given a place of honor in a year being named after each.</p>
			<br />
			<p>The elements – Metal, Water, Wood, Fire, Earth – are an integral part of the Chinese Zodiac which define a universal balance. All things arise from and return to the earth – when we study the Zodiac, it’s important for us to bear the elements in mind, as every one of us are made up of these elements and are deeply connected to them. </p>
